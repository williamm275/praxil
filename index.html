        <h2>Why Us?</h2>
        <p>
          The truth is that interview questions and algorithms are difficult.
          Even more difficult is trying to understand the inner workings of a
          complex algorithm from a book or from a poorly thought-out video shot
          on your grandma's camera. Our crisp 1080p videos boast crystal-clear
          audio and are strategically divided into two parts to give you the
          most comprehensive explanations to questions. That's over 100 hours of
          content specifically tailored to make interview questions and
          algorithms easy.

        <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
        <p>
          We combine self-paced practice with live feedback from tech
          professionals, help from our community managers, and guidance from
          senior students. We introduce sprints, or two-weeks periods of work,
          with a number of tasks to complete by a deadline. Most professional IT
          development takes place in sprints, so this helps prepare you for the
          workplace.
